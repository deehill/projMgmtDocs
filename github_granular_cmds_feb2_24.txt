apparently you can't forkk the app that you're owner of!!
I tried to fork a repos of a test in my github acct!!
	not happening.

not exactly sure what the process of forking does...
	to get copy of files locally from "fork"
	-for the repos
	-do the fork -- does this get a copy of the tgt repos on your github/repos.. 
	-then, on the local sys...
		mkdir /dirA
		cd /dirA
			clone the "forked repos"
			this gets "complete" dir/subdir/files of the repos/proj
		
 
in order to "copy" the files from a gthub project:
	fireup the github/browser to the project url
	https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave

	select the green "code" btn..
	select the download zip link, and unzip the 
	 files on the local side..

-or-
	do a clone of the repos..
	mkdir /devtest 
	cd /devtest
		do the unzip or the clone here...

		gets the proj dir/files

			git clone  -b paddle-billing-api-v2  https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git gfoo
			git clone   https://github.com/adith-a-danthi/hoobank.git /apps/parseapp3/hfoo

		generates the "file"
					with the ".git" dir that maintains the git/history


		git remote -v and press Enter. 
		You will see the current configured remote repository for your fork.

			$ git remote -v
			> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
			> origin  https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)

			//--research "sync" for upstream repos

			$git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/Spoon-Knife.git

			To verify the new upstream repository you have specified for your fork, 
				git remote -v again. 
					You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the upstream repository as upstream.

				$ git remote -v
				> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
				> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
				> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
				> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)

"origin" is the alias for the github/remote repos "url"

git remote rename origin mynewalias
	--does a rename/change of the origin to another "alias"
git remove -v
 --does a list of the aliases (see above)

----for checkout branch
cd repos1
	git checkout -b new-branch
		//switches to new-branch

git branch -a



--need to understand git checkout -b new-branch
 does it create a new dir
 does it operate in the same dir
 what files does it operate on
 how do files get there
 does user manually place them?
 can you do multiple/simultaneous "checkout -b new-branch2"
 eg
	if user is in the "base" dir from the initial "git init"
	 or "git clone foo repos1"
	and user does a "checkout -b new-branch"
	exactly what happens??
		on the remote/github repos
		on the local "repos1" dir


if the localDir for the github/git tests is:
 /rtest

I "cd /rtest"
 in the "rtest" dir
  	git clone   https://github.com/adith-a-danthi/hoobank.git /hfoo
 which then gets/fetches files 
	creates the "repos" files in the 
	/hfoo dir
	.git
	
----or----
is it...
do a clone/setup the base wd
 this would contain the base files you want to work with/from..
 base files could be the base/main of the "tgt_repos" or it 
	could be the "branch" of the "tgt_repos"

either way.. if you do the git remote -v
 what gets shown as the "origin"

if the curdir is then the "wd"
 if you simply make changes to the wd/files/etc..
 are you then working in the "origin"/base dir
 so any git add -A
  git commit
  etc..
  will/should then update the "main" or the input "origin" 
	used from the "git clone"...

  at this point, there is no "branch"...


  
 but..
 
 if you simply make changes to the wd/files/etc..
 are you then working in the "origin"/base dir

 you then do a "git checkout -b "new_branch"
 you still have the "codebase" in the wd/curDir...
 -so any file changes are to the "new_branch"
  the "git remote -v"
    should then show the "branches" as well as 
	 the selected/cur branch..

 so any git add -A
  git commit
  etc..
  will/should then update the tgt "main" or the input "origin" 
	plus "new_branch"

	used from the "git clone"...


need to test/walkthrough this..
then how do you merge?
how do you copy from projA to projB


*****
login as user to github...
 -to create repos
https://github.com/new

git clone https://github.com/other-account/other-repository.git
git clone https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git /home/crawl_user/aa/cptest
cd /home/crawl_user/aa/cptest
git fetch --all

//--shows list of branches
git branch -a

git remote -v

//
//git checkout -b local-branch-name origin/remote-branch-name

git checkout -b feature-y origin/feature-y
git checkout -b paddle-billing-api-v2 https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git/paddle-billing-api-v2


git remote rename origin upstream
 --for copying from wave to upload to deehill ctest
https://github.com/deehill/cptest.git
ssh --> git@github.com/deehill/cptest.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/your-repository.git

git commit
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'upstream/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

inspected the github.com for the cptest repos...
 --files are there!!!

~~~~~!!!!!!!!!so now  branch test...
  //--checks/displays the curBranch   
//git branch newBranch  -creates new branc

//--show branch list
git branch -a
git branch -v -a


//--switch branch from branch list
git switch paddle-billing-api-v2



  //--set the "new-branch"
//git checkout new-branch

//cloning a branch/repos to the local dir
git checkout -b paddle-billing-api-v2 https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git/paddle-billing-api-v2 fooDir
git checkout -b paddle-billing-api-v2 https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git/paddle-billing-api-v2 /home/crawl_user/aa/cptest



//--does the create newBranch, as well as switches to the 'newBranch'
git checkout  -b newBranch

//git checkout new-branch
//git checkout newBranch

cecks/displays the curBranch
//add the files

git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
git push --set-upstream origin paddle-billing-api-v2

/*
	once the branch is pushed..
	go to user/github reload to verify successful update of branch..
*/



/*
need to test to see how to use a branch...
	check it out..
	make some basic mods..
	check it back in..
*/

//--create/set "newBranch"
 git checkout -b newBranch
 git checkout newBranch

//--sets "newBranch" to be used for the remote repos


//--list branches
 git banch -a

echo "sdsdssds " > foo.txt

//new file in the proj
//branch namme selected/specified

update repos with new branch..
//--switch to the "newBranch" to update/upload the modified repos/branch
 git switch newBranch

//--check/list repos branches -- ensure correct one selected 
 git branch -a

//--check/list repos origin
 git remote -v

git add -A

git commit -m "testt"

//--push the 
git push --set-upstream origin newBranch

//?? does the abov work to get new branch??
seems to work..
 the github deehill/newBranch has a pull request..


feb2
need to figre out pull equests..
-how to handle merging..
-how to rollback
-how to update my branch with other changes/updates 
 to test
 -do yo make a "sep" testBranch with all test/change branches..
	test this.. if it works, update the main..
 make each valid "main" a new version
 can always go back to the valid version prio to changes
	updated wih given branches

basic workflow
 uses branch or main
 test on new or testDroplet
 -allow any user to test their branch/main version
 -store test in github/testfolder

test1:
 inputBranch
 inputRepos
 input testDroplet IP
 test will have pubkey for test to run (is this right??)

 test gets run from the testDroplet
 need to fire off/run the test via ssh/exec to the testDroplet
	inside the tgtServer/testApp
	fire off whatever process is required
	log during tests
	define what to log/how to log/where to log for test
	start with "clean" droplet/os
	init tgtServer
	 -meaning, rsync into droplet whatever is required
	 -or just use the base droplet
	fire up the webapp
	run testsuite
	does testsuite get run within tgtServer or 
		by user running the test from their env, or 
		another server
	once testsuite is complete, get the logs, update github/proj/version/logs
 	  for view/checkoff

 find examples/resources/tutors on this
 develop workflows/processes for updating tgtserver with test/rel/prod 
	process..
 this works with the checklist concept/process
 define the items to be on the checklist for the diff subsections
	in the/a workflow


 fetch repos/branch to test
 



/*
	need to test how to do a merge of a branch into the main

	what would be steps??
	hmm i guess...

	connect to github --for git/gh cmds
	get fetch  -- to check out the repos

Took this off the ubuntu list in case someone complained.Oh, if my pinging you with this wasn't cool, my apologies,

But, if it is ok to ask you, here are/is my issue!
Trying to wrap my head around the concept  of "git checkout -b new-branch"
Thought I'd see if you have an understanding or can point me to something that does..
I've been looking at lots of sites.. They seem to say the same things, and I'm missing it.

--need to understand git checkout -b new-branch
 does it create a new dir
 does it operate in the same dir
 what files does it operate on
 how do files get there
 does user manually place them?
 can you do multiple/simultaneous "checkout -b new-branch2"
 eg
    if user is in the "base" dir from the initial "git init"
     or "git clone foo repos1"
    and user does a "checkout -b new-branch"
    exactly what happens??
        on the remote/github repos
        on the local "repos1" dir
  what/how does the user then upload the modified files in the "new-branch"
 
do you have a "workflow" of how this works?

thanks



Hi Michael/BigMike

Thanks for your reply the other day...

I've got the Github/Digital Ocean test droplets to test all of this. But missing something subtle.
