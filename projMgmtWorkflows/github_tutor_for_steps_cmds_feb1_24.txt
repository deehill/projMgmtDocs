github_tutor_for_steps_cmds_feb1_24.txt

Need a projMgr/tutor/guru skilled with github
Need to know the remote/url github.com as 
 well as the comand line toolset for gh / git 
 on windows/linux

usecases

going to be creating some test apps using guthub as the 
 version control system

need to be able create projects from scratch, and place the 
 dir/files in the base repository
need to be able to create/name the init repos


*
use remote/url
 create initial repos -- no dirs/files

using local cmds
 create basic structure with folders/files/subfiles
 do this using mkdir/etc.. (as en example)
 -this is the basic structure of a "test" app
 upload/insert this dir structure into the "base" repos

use sshkey pub/priv for this
create "steps"/commented for the process


*
2nd use a "base/simple" repos example
 -with sshkey access...

the idea is to take/use a couple other github apps 
 in the "new" repos

steps:
  remote
 create the base repos 

 local
 create dir structure -- folders/files
 -use this as the template/structure for updating 
 	the repo
	ex
		topdir
			subdir
			subdir
			subdir
			.
			.

 clone/copy the base repos
 on thelocal/cmdline
 -copy/clone repos1 from github (github.com/foo.git)
	this will have it's own file structure
	add this to the base repos in a subdir
 -copy/clone repos2 from github (github.com/foo2.git)
	this will have it's own file structure
	add this to the base repos in a subdir

 the goal is to show how to take/use folders/structs from 
	other repos in a given repos
	and to then update the base repos with the new/combined 
	strcture

 be able to extract the struct/dirs from the updated repos 
	to be able to then copy the dirs/files from the 
	repos on the local cmdline/env to add to a webserver

 be able to "download"/clone from the repos to make  changes 
	to it, so others can view the changes, and check in 
	the changes to have valid branches..


*
show how to have multiple users make changes to the same "code"/file 
 and 
	track the changes
	merge the changes
	does this generate a different branch?
	how does this work?
	what's this kind of workflow entail?
	what are the steps to do this?



*
it appears the concept of "branch" is the same as "version"
 is this correct?
how do you make changes to a given select version on the 
 cmdline?
if multiple users make changes to a file in a branch, 
 how do the changes get reconciled?
what's the sequence of steps to do this?
	comand line steps/actions --actual cmds (linux -- git/gh)
	user select the repo/branch
	user downloads/uses the branch locally
		does user have ability to download/checkout 
		 single/multiple files? specific folder? 
		how does this work.. need to document this.
	user makes "edits" to the "files" in the given dir(s)
	 -
 	user updates the changes to the files/repos
	process merges changes to files/repos/versions
		do changes go in a given branch/version?
		how do users "ensure" same branch/version 
		 is being worked on?
	what process is/can be deployed to be able to 
	 test a given version/branch/repos being 
	 worked on
	-workflow process for users to be on same 
	 page during the "dev"/testing/release process
	user checks out repos/branch/version for 
	 testing
		process gets the files on the local 
		 system
		process copies/places files in the tgt 
		 dirs for testing
		process runs "testing" scripts (which 
		 would need to be in repos as well)
		process deploys webapp/env as well..

	etc..
need steps for all of this..
so, need to work with you to walk though what steps/workflow 
 has to created
create the process/workflows/steps
test all off this for the github/repos/test scenario
-be able to then have docs/examples of the basic 
 functions of github for 
	creating project repos
	modifying repos
	working in small team on given project
	checking in/out, updating, rolling back project/repo changes
	testing changes on local test system
	working between different versions/branches
	deploy tested code/branch to test/release srvr
	document all steps with example cmds

work with me over a few iterations to get this process working.

	
can/should user check out for local use files from 
 multiple repos?
 -might be needed/used to compare/make changes to 
	diff versions?

how do you "merge" changes made to
