/*
 feb1/24
 using ed25519 as key attribute works only on certain newer machines/os versions
 ubuntu 22+
 windows 10/11
 using the same private key is doable -- should prob use separate keys,,
 use the config file
 --test  
		ssh -vT git@github.com
 to make sure local/remote github ssh keys work

using the 178.128.154.65 
 ubuntu-s-1vcpu-2gb-nyc1-rtt
 -this droplet has the "github" deehill
  sshkey setup on the remote -- github.com 
  as well as in the local /crawl_user/.ssh/config 
		/crawl_user/.ssh/id_ed25519 (*_g) for priv/pub keys..

might need to do the same with the "local/laptop" to be able to 
 use different systems..
 -does this imply needing to mv the priv ey to connect to the 
 	remote/pub key... I would think so..

git clone  -b paddle-billing-api-v2  https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git gfoo
git clone  -b paddle-billing-api-v2  https://github.com/thedevdojo/wave.git gfoo "<<gfoo is the local dir"

git clone https://github.com/deehill/clist.git clist "<< clist is the local dir"



git test actions
setup new git repos
create local dir with folders/files
add local dir to remote repos

mod local dif/folder
 add changes to remote repo

as sep user, or local user see/view file changes to repos

as sep user on another droplet
 create local dir with remote github/repos

make a change to a dir/file from remote repo
does the process require cloning entire repos, 
 or can i have one a part of the repos
 to download/work on
 -then edit
 -then reinsert the change
 




------------------------------------------------------
at this point...
 the priv/pub ssh keys are created
